# OmahaPoker
My first attempt at a big project. I plan to make an Omaha game with a bot.

Initially it will be command line only, but later I plan to try making it into a Linux App. It will be written in C++.

First step is to create a hand analyser that will determine what kind of hand you have, ie straight, flush, pair, etc, based on the best combination of your four hole cards and the board.

Next step, make a dealer class that gives out cards at random from a deck.

Finally make a computer player class that will behave in a certain way based on what cards it has. Hopefully over time I will refine this bot so that it is actually difficult to play against, initially it will be easily beaten.

Finally make an app that represents the game with graphics.

Very long term extension: add network functionality and make it multiplayer.
